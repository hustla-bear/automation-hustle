# THE AUTOMATION HUSTLE SYSTEM
## Make Money While You Sleep: 20 Revenue Machines That Run Themselves

**By Barry Hustla**

## Introduction: Why Automation Changes Everything

Most side hustlers fail because they cap out on time.

You have 168 hours in a week. If you trade 1 hour for $50, max income is $8,400/week. But you can't work 168 hours. Sleep, eat, life. You're capped.

Automation removes the cap.

One script that runs 24/7 can generate revenue equal to 5, 10, or 20 hours of manual work daily. The script doesn't tire. It doesn't charge hourly. It just works.

This guide gives you 20 systems. Each includes:
- **What to build**
- **Tools to use** (free options)
- **Setup time**
- **Revenue potential**
- **Step-by-step instructions**

Pick 3. Build them. Watch your income scale beyond your hours.
